* Introduction to Org-Mode and Worg

[[http://orgmode.org][Org-mode]] is a powerful system for organizing your complex life with
simple plain-text files.  It seamlessly integrates all your notes,
mindmaps, TODO lists, calendar, day planner, and project schedules
into a single system that can be easily searched (e.g. by grep),
encrypted (e.g. by [[http://www.gnupg.org/][GnuPG]]), backed up and synced (e.g.  by Dropbox),
imported/exported, and [[file:org-faq.org::*MobileOrg][accessed on the go]] (e.g. on an iPhone or
Android smartphone).  It can even be used for authoring web pages and
documents.

Check out some [[file:org-screenshots.org][screenshots of Org-mode]] in action.  See [[file:org-quotes.org][what people have to
say]] about Org-mode, and read a few [[file:org-testimonies/index.org][user stories]]!

Org-mode is distributed as part of the popular [[http://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/][Emacs]] text editor and runs
wherever Emacs runs, including on GNU-Linux, Windows, and Mac.  Written by
Carsten Dominik, it is currently maintained by Bastien Guerry and used by
many helpful people who, like you, are desperate to get and stay organized.

The page you're reading is part of =Worg=, a section of the [[http://orgmode.org/][Org-mode web
site]] that is written by a volunteer community of Org-mode fans.  It
includes tutorials, ideas, code snippets, etc., shared to make your
introduction and customization of Org-mode as easy as possible.  Worg is
maintained by Matthew Lundin, a group of [[file:worgers.org][Worg contributors]], and maybe [[file:worg-todo.org][you]].

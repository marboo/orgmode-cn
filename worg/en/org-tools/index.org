[[http://thread.gmane.org/gmane.lisp.picolisp.general/3679][Message]] from the developer Joe Bogner:

: I've written a tiny org-mode parser and hooked it up with my mustache
: implementation to create a simple web page that dumps out the org
: structure. I'm not sure where I'm going to go next but figured I'd
: share it since I enjoy reading other's code as well.
** [[http://common-lisp.net/project/cl-org-mode/][cl-org-mode]] - A Common lisp parser for org-mode outlines

Abstract: CL-ORG-MODE is a parser for org-mode files that uses an
extensible CLOS-based recursive descent parser to create a tree of org-mode
nodes. Also included is a (primitive) system for literate programming using
org-mode
** orgnode.py - python library for parsing Org files

- Author: Charles Cave
- Homepage: [[http://members.optusnet.com.au/~charles57/GTD/orgnode.html]]

: The Orgnode module contains one class, called Orgnode and a routine to read
: an org-mode file and create a list of Orgnode objects.
: 
: The module is for reading an org-mode file. There are no methods for
: writing org-mode since since I have no need for this functionality.
: 
: You are welcome to extend the functionality of the __repr__ method of the
: Orgnode class if you would like this functionality.

: module to add easily a new kind of data and the relative functions.

: - Tables
: - Nodes
: 
: The project is contained in an unique tangle org-file which contains the
: documentation, the python files and the test suite.

up your configuration. But with Octopress All of that is already taken care
of. Simply clone or fork Octopress, install dependencies and the theme, and
you’re set.

** Using GData API to import events in an Org file

: I wrote a Python [[https://bitbucket.org/fgeller/gcal2org/src/8fa7d2b83ab3/gcal2org.py][script]] that uses the GData API to download events for your

** org2remind - perl script to convert org appointments to remind

- Author: Matt Lundin
- Code: [[file:../code/perl/org2remind.pl][org2remind]]

Remind is a command line calendar application for Unix/Linux that
can, among other things, spit out formatted plain text calendars and
agendas.

[[http://www.roaringpenguin.com/products/remind]]

: To convert org-mode appointments to remind data, simply call the
: script on one or more org files:
: 
: perl org2remind.pl ~/org/*.org
: 
: (Optionally, add the script to your path and make it executable.)
: 
: The results of this script can saved in a file...
: 
: perl org2remind.pl ~/org/*.org >> org.rem 
: 
: ...or piped directly into a remind command...
: 
: perl org2remind.pl ~/org/*.org | remind -
: 
: For a nice calendar of the current month, use the following: 
: 
: perl org2remind.pl ~/org/*.org | remind -c -
: 
: This script is similar to org2rem.el (in the contrib directory of the
: org-mode repository), except that, instead of saving files from within
: org-mode, it allows for easier and faster access to org/remind data
: from the command line.
: 
: Currently, the script supports appointments (i.e., active timestamps)
: and the org-diary-class sexp.
** org-manage - locate and manage your org files

  providing a table of org files, including their title and category.

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
This is a module to help managing a large collection of org files. It
is based on org-octopress by Yoshinari Nomura.

org-manage scans a given directory (recursively) looking for org
files. For each, an entry is created. The title is extracted from the
attribute #+TITLE: in the org file. The category is extracted from the
first #+CATEGORY in the file (I suggest you add a default category to
each file.
